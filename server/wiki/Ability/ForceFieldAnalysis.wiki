Force Field Analysis is a technique widely used in problem solving. 
It is designed to identify, in advance, the forces present in the implementation of a desired change, and facilitate positive movement towards the goal by developing strategies to minimise the restraining forces and maximise the driving forces

           Current Situation
                  |
driving forces -->|<-- restraining forces 
                  |
                  
                  
                  
==Good practise==
   Work with the same groups and use the problem statement and change objective produced earlier

   Using Force Field Analysis:
       - first, identify driving forces
       - then restraining forces
   Be prepared to share with the other groups

   Time: 10 minutes group work and 10 minutes sharing
