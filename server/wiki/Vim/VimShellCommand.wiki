These use external programs – ls, grep, date, sort, … (see :help :sort to learn how to use Vim's built-in sort).

:r!ls                : reads in output of ls (use dir on Windows)
:r !grep "^ebay" file.txt  : read output of grep
:20,25 !rot13        : rot13 lines 20 to 25
:r!date              : insert date (use  date /T on Windows)
:.!sh                : execute contents of current line in buffer and capture the output

 Sorting with external sort
:%!sort -u           : contents of the current file is sorted and only unique lines are kept
:'v,'w!sort          : sort from line marked v thru lines marked w
:g/^$/;,/^$/-1!sort  : sort each block (note the crucial ;)

!1} sort             : sorts paragraph; this is issued from normal mode!)

 Entering !! in normal mode is translated to  :.!
 Appending a command sends the current line to the command replacing it with command's result
!!date              : Replace current line with date
!!which command     : Replace current line with the absolute path to command
!!tr -d AEIO        : translate current line deleting As, Es, Is, and Os from the current line

 You can also use ! on a visual selection. Select an area with one of the visualmode
 commands, and then type !command to pipe the whole selection through command.
This is equivalent to :'<,'>!command.
For example, after selecting multiple lines with visualmode:
!sort              : sort selected lines
!grep word         : keep only lines containing 'word' in the selected range.
