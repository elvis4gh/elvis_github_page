找问题，分析问题，总结问题，提出建议，发掘创新的能力

如何丰富分析观察的角度 Are you a Vertical Thinker, Lateral Thinker

涉及到设计思路的问题，就是说如何设计可以避免问题，如何健壮一点，

如何设计容易跟踪、找出问题（root cause）：OM，log，alert、assert，二分法 加状态

Beginner’s mind - We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.

只要找出问题的root cause，问题就解决了一半
   找出root cause了，问题是effort太大了比如test的effort，比如模块间的coupling太强了，修改太多了，怎么办？
   找work around。work around如何找？
   找不出work around？

看如何解决不了的问题：比如，房价如何降下来、癌症

总结AEC的各种机制要解决的问题是：
- keep alive ----> 健壮性 
- redundent  ----> 健壮性 
- overload   ----> NO/exhausted resource issue 
- TCA        ----> NO/exhausted resource issue 
- load-balance --> NO/exhausted resource issue 
- OM         ----> 问题跟踪机制
- log        ----> 问题跟踪机制
   - callp log, csl, designlog, slgtrace, ucli-log


ProblemSolvingProcess
Are you a Vertical Thinker, Lateral Thinker

1.Assess problem scenarios and formulate comprehensive action plans
   A process that helps us clarify and assess the concerns/situations we face and break the complex situation into manageable portions
   
      Identify and clarify concerns: break complex concerns into manageable portions
      Set priority: seriousness, urgency and growth
      Plan next steps: determine analysis needed
      Plan involvement: who does what and when

2.Use QuestioningSkill to secure the right information
   Collect data to enable an in-depth analysis for causes and solutions
  DataCollection 
  
3.Identify and apply the critical steps in problem solving
   Problem Solving Process
      Step 1: Specify the problem
         -	What are the clues of the problem DataCollection 
         -	Identify the problem & specify with a clear statement of purpose – “Should” vs. “Is”
      Step 2: Set the change objective
      Step 3: Analyse the problem
         Identify causes  - CauseEffectDiagram + BrainStorm 
         Evaluate & confirm causes - ForceFieldAnalysis 
      Step 4: Develop change strategy
         •	Evaluate relative impact of driving forces and restraining forces
         •	Select the 3 most significant forces from each side
         •	Go to drivers or restraints easiest to change with the greatest pay-off
         •	Decide on the strategy for implementation: resources vs. feasibility

4.Evaluate risk factors in decision making

==Barriers to Effective PSDM (Problem Solving & Decision Making)==
Insufficient analysis and data support
Distorted facts brought about by self-interest, interdepartmental conflict or a biased perspective
Jumping to conclusion too early
Thinking not broad enough
Not used to follow logical and methodical thought process….
