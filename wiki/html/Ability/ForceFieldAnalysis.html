Force Field Analysis is a technique widely used in problem solving. 
It is designed to identify, in advance, the forces present in the implementation of a desired change, and facilitate positive movement towards the goal by developing strategies to minimise the restraining forces and maximise the driving forces

<h2 id="toc_0.1">Good practise</h2>
<p>
   Work with the same groups and use the problem statement and change objective produced earlier
</p>

<p>
   Using Force Field Analysis:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
first, identify driving forces
</li>
<li>
then restraining forces
   Be prepared to share with the other groups
</li>
</ul>

<p>
   Time: 10 minutes group work and 10 minutes sharing
