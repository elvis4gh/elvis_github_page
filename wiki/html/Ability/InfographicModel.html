<h2 id="toc_1.1">Hardcore Trance</h2>
With a strong, fast beat upwards of 140bpm, hardcore trance is enough to get your blood pumping on the dance floor. In addition to Google, Youtube and Dataportability.org are the hottest dancers right now. The Wall Street Journal is known to explode soon.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.2">Rock ‘n Roll</h2>
<p>
Websites that promise to rock the boat receive the Rock ‘n Roll rating: Facebook (boring, but they have momentum), Yahoo News (recently grabbed 250 local newspapers), The New York Times (strong strategy, brilliant creative director), Twitter (big year ahead), Android (whop, babba lula), and Gmail (steady growth) make the cut.

<h2 id="toc_1.3">Waltzing</h2>
<p>
There is no better music when driving a car than a good, old Vienna Waltz. If your website is waltzing, you are in the zone. Waltzing websites are the ones that run smoothly and have good prospects in continuing at the same pace. If you’re on the main line you should be waltzing, otherwise…

<h2 id="toc_1.4">Snapping Fingers</h2>
<p>
…you’re just snapping fingers. But at least you can feel the rhythm. Websites that are snapping fingers still have energy, but they show signs of exhaustion and need a push back on the dance floor.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.5">Exhausted</h2>
<p>
Dancing is for young people with lots of energy. Some sites show clear signs of getting old. It comes as no surprise that most exhausted websites deliver a bad brand experience. Bad branding is not a sign of aesthetic deficiency, it’s a sign of bad management.
