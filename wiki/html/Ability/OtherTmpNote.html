<h1 id="toc_1">AEM homing within 30s</h1>

<p>
the acceptable time range for all c/s register - 30s for all 1500AEMs/3000 carriers/9000 sectors.
</p>


<p>
 the register speed is 100AEMs/second 
</p>
<blockquote>
2 AEMs/second for every app, totally there is 50 apps
so the register speed is 100AEMs/second when I runapp on all CMUST together.
</blockquote>
    
<p>
While from RCP tmaem logs, the whole registration took 6 minutes (from 1st AEM to all AEM status turn to NORM with all carrier/sector status turn to 1).  Need to confirm:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Whether CMUST sent all AEMs registration messages/with all carrier/sector info to AEC in 30s
      We found CMUST not sent all carriers' register messages in 30s to AEC,
      it sends the carrier's status to AEC till the previous carrier's status turns to 1.
</li>
</ul>
   
<ul>
<li>
Whether AEC can handle all these registrations (1500AEM, 3000 carriers, 9000 sectors) in 30s
</li>
</ul>


<p>
As you know from the EEGS 1.1 result, It had been already discussed and passed during EEGS 1.1 testing as well.
</p>

<p>
I don’t believe that All AEMs are not ready for Call setup until 6 minutes.
The earlier the AEMs are homed, the faster the Call setup will be ready
It means a lot of AEMs can be ready for call setup within 6 minutes
</p>

<p>
There are lots of message transition between AEC and AEM during Homing procedure and We have a limitation for network load (specially TIPC routing) We remembered there were lots of issues for TIPC multi-casting or uni-casting…So AEC had to implemented the pace control so that we could provide more stable homing procedure.

<p>
From the log, as soon as there is &gt;=1 sector is ready, AEM status will turn to NORM, I think that's what we called "ready for callp".

<p>
1. AEM from 0 to 1500:  ~30s 10/22/2012T4:39:08 PM  - 10/22/2012T4:39:37 PM.  But only have 671 NORM AEM(status=NORM, have &gt;1 sector in service)
TOTAL_AEM = 1500, NORM_AEM = 671, NORM_SECT = 1034, INIT_SECT = 474, ABN_SECT = 0
</p>

<p>
2. All 1500 AEM status NORM: 10/22/2012T4:43:07 PM, took ~4 minutes
TOTAL_AEM = 1500, NORM_AEM = 1500, NORM_SECT = 4320, INIT_SECT = 636, ABN_SECT = 0
</p>

<p>
3.All Carrier/Secotor's status turn to normal: 10/22/2012T4:45:36 PM, from 4:39:37 to 4:45:36, it takes 6 minutes for All AEM's Sectors turning to normal. 
TOTAL_AEM = 1500, NORM_AEM = 1500, NORM_SECT = 9000, INIT_SECT = 0, ABN_SECT = 0
